I am a Senior year undergrad in Computer Science and Enginnering from International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad.

I am interested in algorithm design, data structures, computer graphics and computer vision. Lately, I have developed keen interest in parallel programming and the idea of leveraging graphics and vision algorithms using GPGPUs. I find the blend of high performance computing with computer graphics and vision very elegant.

Having participated in Google Summer of Code '13 and '14, developed a lot of interest in open source software development. With the idea of helping people hit by disasters with the use of technology, I have been working actively with Sahana Software Foundation on their Humanitarian FOSS projects.
